# Anki Randomizer: Memorize the *Concept*, not the Card
Purpose: Combat the association of your memory to the specific cue of your card.

Do you have card that you recognize the answer to by the structure of the card, rather than the meaning of the words?

By having multiple different wordings for the question of your card's front, this (hopefully) forces you to recall the answer to the meaning of the question, rather than overfitting your brain on the front of the card.
